`ESP-01` allows connecting IoT device to WIFI. They can communicate through
[Serial port]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2016-07-14-serial-protocol %})
using commands, which will be listed shortly.

It operates on `3.3v`, so when connecting it to device operating on `5v` like
arduino board, or some `USB - UART TTL` converters one must use Level Converter.

To initiate communication - `CH_PD` must be pulled to `3.3v`.

Connecting to USB
-----------------

I've used `CH340G` based `USB - UART TTL` converter. It seems that power available
on it's `3.3v` power supply is not enough, so external power source is required.

Best way to quickly plug `ESP-01` to converter, is to build (or buy) nice breakout
board. It must be possible to easily plug both devices into it, and execute usual
operations fast. For example, pull `CH_PD` to `3.3v` or click `RESET` button.

My Current Problems
-------------------

Seems to be not that easy to build breakout board, mainly - how to well solder it.

Also, it must be possible to use either native power supply, or (as in my case) -
to put third party power support. This should be configurable.
