*Voltage* is the difference in charge between two points. It is measured in volts, and represented in equations and schematics by the letter `V`.

*Current* is the rate at which charge is flowing. Current is measured in Amperes (usually just referred to as "Amps"). Amps are represented in equations by the letter `I`.

*Resistance* is a material’s tendency to resist the flow of charge (current). Unit of resistance is "1 Ohm", defined as the resistance between two points in a conductor where the application of 1 volt will push 1 ampere, or 6.241×10^18 electrons. This value is usually represented in schematics with the greek letter `Ω`, which is called omega, and pronounced “ohm”.

Ohm's Law
---------

Combining the elements of voltage, current, and resistance, Ohm developed the formula:

V = I * R

Where

 * V = Voltage in volts
 * I = Current in amps
 * R = Resistance in ohms

Kirchhoff's First Law
---------------------

Summation of all Current in any point of circuit equals to `0`.

Kirchhoff's Second Law
----------------------

Summation of all Voltage in any Loop always equals to `0`.
